# Configuration

`mark` works without a config file. Create one only when you want to override
syntax behavior, colors, diff rendering, highlight performance limits, or
keybindings.

Print the exact config path for the current machine:

```sh
mark config
```

On XDG systems this is usually `~/.config/mark/config.toml`. `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is
honored. Windows uses `APPDATA` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset.

Syntax language state is stored separately as `syntax.json` under the same
`mark` config directory. Bundled TextMate grammars ship with `mark` and do not
need runtime downloads.
Inspect syntax mappings, config, and colorscheme paths with:

```sh
mark syntax path
```

## Example

```toml
mode = "builtin"
colorscheme = "system"
transparent_background = false
layout = "dynamic"
live_reload = true
syntax_highlighting = true
line_wrapping = false

[notifications]
mode = "default"
corner = "top-right"
timeout_ms = 1500
max_visible = 3

[diff]
line_background = "subtle"
gutter_background = "delta"
inline_background = "strong"
sign_style = "bold"
empty_fill = false

[limits]
max_source_kib = 1024
max_line_kib = 8
cache_entries = 512
queue_entries = 512
prefetch_viewports = 1

[keymap.global]
help = "?"
reload = "r"
file_filter = "f"
grep = "/"
diff_menu = "m"
head_branch = []
base_branch = []
commit_picker = []
options_menu = "o"
annotation_menu = "n"
file_browser = "b"
previous_file = "("
next_file = ")"
previous_hunk = "["
next_hunk = "]"
expand_context_up = ","
expand_context_down = "."
collapse_context_all = "c"
quit = "q"
layout = "s"
edit_hunk = "ctrl-g"
save_mark = "ctrl-s"
cancel_mark = "esc"

copy_error_log = "ctrl-shift-c"
clear_filters = "ctrl-u"
next_diff_type = "tab"
previous_diff_type = "shift-tab"
next_annotation = "}"
previous_annotation = "{"

[keymap.annotation_menu]
jump = "enter"
edit_external = "ctrl-g"
remove = "ctrl-x"

[keymap.menu]
up = ["up", "shift-tab", "ctrl-p"]
down = ["down", "tab", "ctrl-n"]
select = []
confirm = "enter"
close = "esc"
```

## Syntax mode

`mode` controls which languages are eligible for syntax highlighting:

```toml
mode = "builtin"
```

Supported values:

- `builtin` - all bundled languages with TextMate grammar support. This is the default.
- `enabled` - core languages plus languages enabled with `mark syntax add`, for users who want a smaller explicit allow-list.
- `all` - currently equivalent to `builtin`; kept for config compatibility.

Use `mark --no-syntax`, `mark diff --no-syntax`, `mark show --no-syntax`, or
`mark patch --no-syntax changes.diff` to disable syntax highlighting for one run.

## Colorschemes and colors

Use a built-in colorscheme by name:

```toml
colorscheme = "system"
```

Built-in colorschemes are `system`, `catppuccin-latte`,
`catppuccin-frappe`, `catppuccin-macchiato`, `catppuccin-mocha`,
`gruvbox-dark`, `gruvbox-light`, `github-dark`,
`github-dark-high-contrast`, `github-light`, `github-light-high-contrast`,
and `tokyonight`.

Changing Colorscheme in the interactive settings menu updates the
`colorscheme` config value.

Base16 themes can be loaded from a file:

```toml
[colorscheme]
source = "base16"
path = "~/themes/example.yaml"
```

Individual colors can be overridden at the top level or in `[colors]`:

```toml
bg = "#111315"
fg = "#d8dee9"

[colors]
addition_bg = "#1f3025"
deletion_bg = "#372526"
keyword = "ansi-5"
string = "green"
```

Color values support hex colors, ANSI indexes such as `ansi-5`, and named
terminal colors.

`cursor` colors the block caret in all text inputs (filter bar, menus, review ID, and
annotation compose). Built-in schemes usually set it to the palette foreground (often the
scheme's white or brightest text), similar to Neovim's normal-mode cursor. Override with
`cursor` in config or `[colors]`. `cursor_line_bg` colors the mouse-hover highlight on diff
code columns (Neovim-style cursorline). With `colorscheme = "system"`, `cursor` uses the
terminal default foreground (`reset`) and `cursor_line_bg` uses ANSI palette index 237 so
both follow the emulator theme unless overridden in `[colors]`.

Common override keys include:

```text
bg, fg, header, file, hunk, notice, cursor, cursor_line_bg, muted, gutter_bg, empty_diff,
search_match_fg, search_match_bg,
statusline_fg, statusline_bg, statusline_accent_fg, statusline_accent_bg,
statusline_info_fg, statusline_info_bg,
addition_fg, addition_gutter_bg, addition_bg, addition_inline_bg,
deletion_fg, deletion_gutter_bg, deletion_bg, deletion_inline_bg,
attribute, comment, constant, constructor, function, keyword, label, module,
number, operator, property, punctuation, string, tag, type, variable
```

## Diff rendering

Top-level UI settings are read at startup and mirror the interactive settings
menu:

```toml
layout = "dynamic"           # dynamic, unified, split
live_reload = true
syntax_highlighting = true
line_wrapping = false
```

`layout = "dynamic"` uses split when the terminal is wide enough and unified
when it is narrow.
Changing these values in the settings menu only affects the current session;
only Colorscheme changes are written back to config.

## Notifications

Toasts are separate from the error pane. The error pane is still used for
errors and longer diagnostic text; toasts are for short, transient feedback.

```toml
[notifications]
mode = "default"      # default, debug
corner = "top-right"  # top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right
timeout_ms = 1500
max_visible = 3
```

`mode = "default"` stays quiet except for feedback that would otherwise be hard
to infer, such as a copy action completing or a requested action having no
matching target. `mode = "debug"` also emits a toast for each terminal event to
make UI behavior easier to trace.

The configured `timeout_ms` is clamped to 10,000 ms.

These notification settings can also be changed from the interactive settings
menu for the current session.

`[diff]` controls visual emphasis:

```toml
[diff]
line_background = "subtle"   # none, subtle, strong
gutter_background = "delta"  # base, delta
inline_background = "strong" # none, subtle, strong
sign_style = "bold"          # normal, bold
empty_fill = false            # false leaves empty split cells blank; true uses diagonal fill
```

`word_background` and `word_diff_background` are accepted aliases for
`inline_background`. `empty_diff_fill` is accepted as an alias for
`empty_fill`. Collapsed unchanged context expands fully when clicked.
Legacy `context_lines`, `context_expand`, and `expand_context` settings are
accepted for compatibility but no longer limit interactive context expansion.

## Highlight limits

Large files and very long lines are intentionally bounded:

```toml
[limits]
max_source_kib = 1024
max_line_kib = 8
cache_entries = 512
queue_entries = 512
prefetch_viewports = 1
```

## Keybindings

Global bindings can be one-key or two-key bindings. A one-key global binding
cannot also be used as a two-key prefix. Menu bindings are single-key and apply
to searchable menus. Printable menu bindings override text input, so prefer
non-printing keys to keep type-to-filter behavior. `edit_hunk`, `save_mark`, and
`cancel_mark` must be single-key bindings.

Bindings can be a string or a list of strings:

```toml
[keymap.global]
help = ["?", "h ?"]
file_filter = "ctrl-f"
diff_menu = "m"
head_branch = []
base_branch = []
commit_picker = []
copy_marks = "y"
save_mark = "ctrl-s"
cancel_mark = "esc"
quit = "q"

[keymap.menu]
up = ["up", "ctrl-p"]
down = ["down", "ctrl-n"]
select = []
confirm = "enter"
close = "esc"
```

Use an empty list, such as `copy_marks = []`, or an empty string, such as
`copy_marks = ""`, to unbind an action.

Key names include printable characters plus names such as `space`, `enter`,
`esc`, `tab`, `shift-tab`, `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, and modified keys such
as `ctrl-s`.

If the keymap cannot be parsed, `mark` ignores it for that run and shows a notice
inside the TUI instead of failing the diff review.
